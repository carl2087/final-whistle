# The Final Whistle

The Final Whistle is a full stack web application built using the Django Framework. The main purpose of the site is to provide a platform for the user to write a short blog posting their opinion on the current affairs that is happening in football. The intended target audience is anyone who has an interest in football from teenagers to adults. 

The application has full CRUD functionality for user generated posts and provides an easy for other users of the site to comment on the posts upvote and downvote posts and create their own accounts as well.

The site also features a back-end admin dashboard that allows admin of the site to review and authorise posts as well as comments.

# Project objectives

## Main objective

The main objective of this project was to create a full stack website as part of [The Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.
This project is my fourth portfolio project on the course. Amongst other assesment criteria, this project had to be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and the Django framework, and feature full CRUD functionality and user authorisation. The project also had to be planned and designed using agile methodologies. 

One of my main interests is sports I decided to create a website where users of the site can create posts about the current affairs in football.

My aim was to create a minimum viable product that can be built upon with more features in the future and also to create a website that I would enjoy creating and using in the future as well.

## Site users

Users of the site can create posts, and comments, upvote and downvote posts and add tags to their own created posts. Users can view, edit and delete their own posts also.
I tried to make the site as appealing as it could be to as broad of an audience as possible with a clear layout an easy way of learning how to use the site and the ability to 
customise the created posts with an image.

## Site owner

The goal for the site owner is to provide a stable user experience that is enjoyable to encourage user interaction. The site should be accessible and appealing to new users, it should also be scaleable with an easy way to add more features in the future. Content on the site should be easily moderated to ensure community standards are met and be of high quality. The GitHub project board had a to do section where user stories where first placed, an in progress tab where user stories where moved to when being worked on, a done section where the stories where moved when completed. A bugs tab for any coding problems that arose during the process and a won't-have section for features that where not included in this stage of the project.

# Project management

I managed this project using an [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) methodology. I used GitHub projects to refine epic tasks to break them down into user stories. This ensured that tracking and organising the project into iterations was manageable.
